# Unjumble
<hr>
Inspiration
The theme of this weekend's hackathon inspired me to create something of my own which I could use up at the times I get bored. So here it is, Unjumble.

What it does
Unjumble is a fun game which allows user to create jigsaw puzzles out of any custom image that they add. Let it be the picture of your favorite cartoon character or your best friend's random funny image or anything, Unjumble would create an amazing jigsaw puzzle out of it for you to solve. Moreover, there are many features like a counter which tracks the number of steps which you took to solve the puzzle as well as a timer which displays the total time that you took to complete the entire puzzle. Apart from this, we have added a group of radio button where user could navigate between the levels of difficulties (Easy/Medium/Hard) which we have provided and the puzzles get further broken into more number of pieces depending upon the difficulty level chosen by the player.

How we built it
We built it using mostly vanilla javascript and some necessary JS libraries. HTML, CSS and some other CSS frameworks were used as frontend.
